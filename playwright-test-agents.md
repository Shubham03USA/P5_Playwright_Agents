# Playwright Test Agents

**Official Documentation:** https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents

## Introduction

Playwright Test Agents are AI-powered assistants introduced in Playwright that automate the complete test automation workflow. Instead of manually creating, maintaining, and fixing test scripts, these agents perform the work using natural language prompts.

Playwright provides three built-in Test Agents:

- **Planner** – Explores the application and creates a test plan.
- **Generator** – Converts the test plan into Playwright test scripts.
- **Healer** – Executes the tests and automatically repairs failing tests.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Before using Playwright Test Agents, make sure the following software is installed.

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**

   Install the latest version of Visual Studio Code.

2. **Enable GitHub Copilot**

   Playwright Test Agents currently work inside VS Code using GitHub Copilot.

3. **Install Playwright**

   Install Playwright along with the required browsers.

   ```bash
   npm init playwright@latest
   ```

4. **Install Playwright Test Agents**

   Run the following command inside your Playwright project:

   ```bash
   npx playwright init-agents --loop=vscode
   ```

   After the installation completes, Playwright automatically:

   - Installs the Test Agents
   - Installs the Playwright MCP Server
   - Creates the required configuration files
   - Updates the project structure

## Agent 1 – Playwright Test Planner

### Purpose

The Planner Agent explores your web application and generates a detailed test plan in Markdown format.

Instead of manually writing test scenarios, the AI understands the application and creates them automatically.

### Example Prompt

Select the agent:

```text
playwright-test-planner
```

Prompt:

```text
Explore the user interface of the web application at
https://www.saucedemo.com

Based on your exploration, create a test plan covering the five core user operations
that a typical end user would perform on this e-commerce demo site.
```

### Alternative Prompt

Instead of exploring the application, you can provide a Product Requirements Document (PRD).

Example:

```text
Analyze the attached PRD and generate a complete Playwright test plan.
```

This approach is useful when the application is still under development.

### Output

The Planner creates a Markdown test plan.

Example:

```text
sauce-demo-core-user-operations.plan.md
```

The generated test plan typically includes scenarios such as:

- User Login
- Product Browsing
- Add Products to Cart
- Cart Review and Modification
- Checkout Process
- Logout
- Reset Application State

## Agent 2 – Playwright Test Generator

### Purpose

The Generator Agent converts the Markdown test plan into executable Playwright test scripts.

It automatically generates:

- Playwright test files
- Assertions
- Locators
- Test structure
- Organized test cases

### Example Prompt

Select the agent:

```text
playwright-test-generator
```

**Prompt 1:** To generate tests for all the scenarios from the test plan:

```text
Generate Playwright tests for all the scenarios provided in the test plan.
```

**Prompt 2:** To generate a test for a specific scenario from the test plan:

```text
Create a Playwright test for scenario 1.1 from test-plan.md using the Playwright test generator agent.
```

**Prompt 3: Generate Tests Using Page Object Model (POM):**

```text
Generate Playwright tests for all the test scenarios provided in the test plan.

Requirements:
- Use TypeScript.
- Follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
- Create a separate Page Object class for each application page.
- Keep page locators and reusable page actions inside the Page Object classes.
- Keep test assertions and business scenarios inside the test (.spec.ts) files.
- Use Playwright's built-in locators (getByRole, getByLabel, getByText, getByPlaceholder, etc.) whenever possible.
- Avoid XPath unless absolutely necessary.
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Organize the generated files using the following structure:

pages/
  LoginPage.ts
tests/
  login.spec.ts

- Reuse Page Object methods across multiple tests.
- Generate meaningful method names and comments where appropriate.
- Follow Playwright and TypeScript best practices.
```

### Output

The Generator creates Playwright test files, for example:

```text
tests/
│
├── login.spec.ts
├── products.spec.ts
├── cart.spec.ts
├── checkout.spec.ts
└── logout.spec.ts
```

These test files are ready to execute with minimal or no manual changes.

## Agent 3 – Playwright Test Healer

### Purpose

The Healer Agent runs the generated tests, identifies failures, and automatically attempts to repair them.

Common issues it can resolve include:

- Broken locators
- Minor UI changes
- Timing issues
- Synchronization problems
- Small test maintenance fixes

This significantly reduces manual maintenance effort.

### Example Prompt

Select the agent:

```text
playwright-test-healer
```

Prompt:

```text
Run all the tests until every test passes.
```

### Output

The Healer:

1. Executes the entire test suite
2. Detects failing tests
3. Analyzes the failure
4. Repairs the test automatically
5. Re-runs the tests
6. Repeats the process until all tests pass (where possible)

## Advantages of Playwright Test Agents

- AI-powered end-to-end test automation
- No need to manually write every test
- Automatically explores the application
- Generates structured test plans
- Creates Playwright test scripts
- Reduces test maintenance effort
- Automatically fixes common test failures
- Improves test reliability
- Saves significant development time
- Ideal for both beginners and experienced automation engineers

## Summary

Playwright Test Agents automate the complete test automation lifecycle.

| Agent | Responsibility | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Planner** | Explores the application and creates a test plan | Markdown Test Plan (`.plan.md`) |
| **Generator** | Converts the test plan into Playwright tests | `.spec.ts` files |
| **Healer** | Executes and repairs failing tests | Stable and maintainable test suite |

By combining these three agents, you can move from application exploration to fully automated, self-healing Playwright tests with minimal manual effort.
